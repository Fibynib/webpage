                <p>
                    During my second and third year of college, I joined a robotics team called <strong>Yonder Dynamics</strong>.
                    They participate in the University Rover Challenge (URC) held by the Mars Society where teams build a pseudo-mars rover
                    and program it such that it can perform tasks either manually through a controller or autonomously.
                </p>

                <details>
                    <summary>URC</summary>
                    <p>
                        There are 4 main missions to complete during the URC. The rover is designed to analyze life or possibility of life given soil samples,
                        search and gather specific items for astronauts when manually controlled from a remote base station, perform precise tasks using the arm,
                        and <span id="auto">autonomously navigate</span> the desert, going to each specified point, whether it is given by a GNSS coordinate, an Aruco Tag posted on
                        the field, or items on the ground. 
                    </p>

                    As a software team member, one of our main priorities is the autonomous navigation task. I designed and
                    implemented a state machine that structurally decided on what the rover should do at a given time based on an input/event. This state machine
                    connected our computer vision algorithm of finding Aruco tags or objects as well as our GNSS information, including long/lat coordinates and orientation, 
                    taken from a compass through the use of <code>ROS sub/pub messaging</code>. Based on these info, as well as using time to implement a failsafe, the state machine
                    would seamlessly transition to a new state considering all cases.

                    During my high school years, from freshmen to until COVID-19 hit, I was in a team that participated in KIPR Botball, in which teams across the world would
                    compete to build and program robots to perform various tasks on a gameboard given a certain time limit. There were various tasks on the board, so we would
                    have to design an optimal game plan that would score as many points in the time we were given. 
                </p>

                <aside>
                    They allowed for two robots for each team powered by their own custom KIPR brain and library using C.
                    We also attached one brain to a Roomba to program it to perform actions stronger than our custom-built smaller bot.

                    MathML was not used as it was not widely supported until 2023, where most of the popular browsers: chrome and edge 
                    started being able to use it. Even when it was supported in 2016 by safari or 2011 by firefox, their usage was only 2.5-5%.
                    Chrome, however, had a global usage of 25% at the time. Therefore, to consider the different types of browsers that users use,
                    developers would not be able to utilize it if they wanted to reach a broad audience.
